            "value": 100,
            "question": "How do fossils form?",
            "answer": "Fossils form when organic materials, such as bones or shells, are replaced by minerals over time, creating a replica of the original organism."
        },

            "value": 200,
            "question": "What is the process of fossilization?",
            "answer": "Fossilization occurs when the remains of an organism are buried by sediment, and minerals in the surrounding environment replace the organic materials over time."
        },

            "category": "Fossils",
            "value": 400,
            "question": "What is petrification?",
            "answer": "Petrification is the process in which minerals replace the organic material of an organism, resulting in a fossil that is essentially a stone replica of the original organism."

            "question": "What is carbonization?",
            "answer": "Carbonization occurs when an organism is compressed and heated, causing the water and other volatile components to evaporate and leaving behind a thin layer of carbon that outlines the organism's shape."
        },

            "question": "How do fossils provide evidence for evolution?",
            "answer": "Fossils provide physical evidence of ancient organisms that lived in the past and allow us to study the characteristics and features of organisms that are no longer present in modern populations."

            "question": "What can we learn from the fossil record about the history of life on Earth?",
            "answer": "The fossil record provides evidence of the history of life on Earth, including the evolution of various groups of organisms over time, the appearance and disappearance of species, and the impact of environmental changes on the evolution of life."

            "category": "Fossils and Evolution",
            "value": 300,
            "question": "What is the difference between homologous and analogous structures, and how do they relate to evolution?",
            "answer": "Homologous structures are anatomical structures that have a common evolutionary origin, while analogous structures are structures that have a similar function but different evolutionary origins. Homologous structures provide evidence of common ancestry, while analogous structures suggest convergent evolution in response to similar environmental pressures."

            "question": "What is punctuated equilibrium, and how does it relate to the fossil record?",
            "answer": "Punctuated equilibrium is a theory that suggests that evolutionary change occurs in short bursts of rapid change, followed by long periods of stasis, where little or no change occurs. The fossil record provides evidence for this theory, as it shows periods of rapid speciation followed by long periods of stasis where species remain relatively unchanged."

            "value": 500,
            "question": "How do transitional fossils provide evidence for evolution?",
            "answer": "Transitional fossils provide evidence of the intermediate forms of organisms that link different groups of organisms together in evolutionary history. They show how features of organisms have changed over time and provide evidence of the evolutionary pathways that led to the development of modern organisms."

            "question": "What is fossil preservation?",
            "answer": "Fossil preservation refers to the processes by which organic remains, such as bones or shells, become part of the rock record as fossils."

            "question": "What is mineralization?",
            "answer": "Mineralization is a type of fossil preservation where minerals replace the organic material of an organism, creating a fossil with the same shape as the original."
        },
        {
            "category": "Fossils",
            "value": 400,
            "question": "What is carbonization?",
            "answer": "Carbonization is a type of fossil preservation where a thin film of carbon residue is left behind when organic material is compressed and heated, creating a fossil that resembles a dark silhouette of the original."
        },
        {
            "category": "Fossils",
            "value": 500,
            "question": "What is permineralization?",
            "answer": "Permineralization is a type of fossil preservation where the organic material is slowly replaced by minerals that fill the empty spaces within the organism's structure, creating a fossil that shows both the original structure and the new minerals."
