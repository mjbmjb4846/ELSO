            "question": "What is the difference between droplet transmission and airborne transmission of diseases?",
            "answer": "Droplet transmission refers to the transmission of a disease through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes, and can travel up to a few feet before falling to the ground. Airborne transmission refers to the transmission of a disease through smaller particles, known as aerosols, which can travel longer distances and remain in the air for longer periods of time."

            "value": 200,

            "answer": "Vaccines work by exposing the immune system to a harmless part of a disease-causing agent (such as a protein from the virus or bacteria) or a weakened or inactivated form of the agent. This stimulates the immune system to produce an immune response that can recognize and fight the disease-causing agent if it is encountered in the future."
